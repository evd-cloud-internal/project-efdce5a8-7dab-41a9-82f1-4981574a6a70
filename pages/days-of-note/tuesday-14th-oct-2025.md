# Tuesday, 14th Oct 2025


Market setup
The day started with all major CCGTs on PN — Rye House (RYHPS), Connah’s Quay units (CNQP), South Humber Bank (SHBA), Seabank (SEAB), and Medway (MEDP).
With Rye House on PN, it signalled they saw better value in the auctions than in the imbalance market — a bearish imbalance signal in my view.

There were no major wind forecast movements; outturn had been over wind PNs overnight.
We saw strong demand over the morning peak due to poor solar and temperatures dipping below forecast.
However, with no demand forecast movement from DA and solar looking well covered through the morning (inline with the models), my view was that demand would ease after the morning peak.

Interconnectors
Looking at the interconnector DA flows:

France (FR): Full import — no headroom to increase.

NEMO (BE) and Britned (BN): Room to increase imports.

Since I didn’t have a clear view of which CCGTs were spare for NG to turn on, my concern was that if the system went short, NG would be highly exposed to NL (Dutch) prices.
I couldn’t see NL imbalance prices on EQ Freemium, and although German DA prices were strong, I didn’t have a firm view on NL at the time — in hindsight, maybe I should have.

Initial market view
With Rye House and others all on PN ( they saw more value in sell generation into the auction compared to the BM), no bullish wind signal, decent interconnector headroom, and demand in line with forecasts,
I held a bearish view, bidding Block 5B at £180 (auction cleared at £160).

Midday developments
Around 12:00, RYHPS, CNQP, and MEDP all came off PN and offered themselves on extension in the BM.
12:00 is a clever time to do this — if NG were to drop any of these units, they would become unavailable for around six hours (including ramp-down), meaning they’d be out until roughly 18:30 — a bit late for the evening peak.

Would NG risk that? Depends on who else NG had available for peak coverage.
Initial extension prices were high but not as extreme as yesterday.

Coming into Block 5
As we moved into Block 5, and units grew confident NG would keep them running for peak, by SP33 they all raised their BM extension offer prices.

At the same time, we saw a large BSAD volume (blue) appear in SP33, priced around £145/MWh (green) on the short side.

SP33 is in the last hour of Block 5A (16:00).

The market, again fearful of expensive CCGT offers, had Block 5B trading above £210, well above these BSAD levels.

Once the BSADs at £145 appeared, market prices crashed as the expected short cashout dropped sharply — a similar trend was visible across the SPs.

How marginal the system was
Worth noting: the system was extremely marginal throughout Block 4 (11:00–15:00).
There were four SPs where the imbalance was <5 MW.

SP32 (the SP ending one hour before 5B starts delivery) actually went long at £69/MWh.
Ironically, even though that period went long, 5B was still trading in the £200s, suggesting the market still priced those two hours as short — aligning closer to CCGT expectations at the time.

When the 5B came into delivery, the first two SPs went long at £95 and £83 respectively — despite those earlier high prices.

 

BSAD pricing and market behaviour
The short cashout today could have been extremely punishing.
BSADs were priced up to £300, it’s unclear whether those prices reflected true continental market levels, or whether BSAD participants were pricing strategically, i.e. pricing their power in the BSAD auctions against where they thought the CCGT BM offer prices would go rather than where the conti was truly trading e.g. selling power to NG at £300 in the BSAD auction (below CCGT levels) and then closing the continental leg of that trade at the true continental market price e.g. £100.

It’s hard to say whether the trading behaviour in 5B and its SPs came from nervous traders or algos.
My view is that algos were inflating prices, as they don’t react to BSAD auction results until NG updates interconnector PNs — at which point they crash the market back down.

By contrast, human intraday traders — especially those participating in BSAD auctions — would anticipate these flows earlier, since NG publishes BSAD auction results ie volume and prices before NG update the PNs.
That means you can see upcoming BSAD flows before the algos react.

Interconnector flows
Today, NG did not flip Britned as they did yesterday.
As shown on the chart (dark vs light blue):

Light blue = DA nominations

Dark blue = actual physical flows
Today, they reduced exports but didn’t fully reverse direction
