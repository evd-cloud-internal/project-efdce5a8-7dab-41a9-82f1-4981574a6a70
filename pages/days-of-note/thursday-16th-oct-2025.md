# Thursday, 16th Oct 2025

System Summary

Spare units: CNQPS 1 & 4, RYH House, and Medway all spare.

Wind: Over-performed vs forecasts from DA (Day Ahead) until ~1900, when it fell back in line with DA levels.

Tesla demand: Up from DA levels, but no BMRS forecast movement observed.

Solar: Much more covered (cloudier) than EC models predicted → higher demand than forecast.


Interconnectors:

Full imports from France, Belgium, and Netherlands from 10:00.

IFA (France) came back online after Monday’s trip, increasing import capacity.

NG (National Grid) had limited import room but good export potential if flow reversal was needed.

System Conditions

Coryton tripped at 05:00 (350 MW loss), but wind over-performance meant the system was only ~120 MW short.

It does look like the unit did come back generating at 08:00

To cover the Coryton trip, NG took ROCK at a low offer on price of 109 - meaning it was maybe a early sync price ie they had a PN in for later on in the day

The system turned long from ~0830 onwards and stayed that way for the rest of the day.

ROCK s PN appeared at 1400 -  purple line.

CNQPS1 had a PN after 16:00.

Seabank 1 had PN but came off at 1200 - prime example of being too late to the party as they were not taken and the N2EX prices being in the money to run a PN into the peak 

Rye House remained available with no PN and was not run today

 

Market Behaviour

5-block (5b) trading:

Prices rose from ~118 → 127 £/MWh, then fell sharply as the system looked increasingly long closer to delivery.

Likely overreaction early to the SBHA BM offer price of 138 but this was followed by correction once imbalance risk reduced and the system having out turned long all day, looked less short/ longer as it came closer to delivery

Small BSAD auction was called to manage the interconnector constraint

It is also possible there was commercial intraday exports from GB to FR, consistent with GB being more bearish and FR more bullish after 13:00

FR imbalance - but again cannot say this for sure a I cannot see the FR intraday market

Overall Takeaway

The UK power system was short in the morning on the Coryton trip but turned long soon after, and stayed long.

Key drivers: wind overperformance, lower than expected CCGT BM offer prices 

ROCK’s early sync and FR interconnector adjustments were the most notable operational events.
