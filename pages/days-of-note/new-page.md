# Monday, 13th Oct 2025

OTC was trading  very high on Friday for Monday delivery.
It’s the first low-wind day in a while, with warm temperatures expected.

Block 5 OTC traded up to 158, while Block 5 N2EX cleared at 160.

Baseload CCGT sparks were significantly in the money across efficient, semi-efficient, and inefficient units — meaning almost all CCGTs would have been selling at the auction price.

Whoever did not sell their generation would have forgone that auction value in hopes of making more money if National Grid (NG) turned them on in the Balancing Mechanism (BM) at a higher price, becuase they would be one of very few units available to Nationall grid to turn on. 

Looking at CCGT PNs in the morning:

-Seabank (SEAB)
-Damhead Creek (DAMC)
-Connah’s Quay (CNQP)


were all running on PN from 03:00, meaning they were unavailable for NG to turn on — and therefore couldn’t set the short cashout imbalance price.

The most notable unit was Rye House (RYHPS), which was not running on PN, making it fully available for NG to turn on and potentially set the cashout price.

Given that the same team manages RYHPS and DAMC — and both units have comparable efficiency — we know that if DAMC was in the money to run, so was RYHPS. Therefore, RYHPS was purposefully held back to capture potential BM value.
At this stage, NG would have been reviewing:

Current PNs of all units

BM offer prices

GB interconnector positions

Continental (Conti) intraday prices

They would assess whether it was cheaper to increase imports or reduce exports across interconnectors rather than turning on RYHPS for six hours.

Interconnectors

GB was fully importing from France (FR) — no room to increase.

GB was partially importing from Belgium (BE) — some room available.

GB was importing and exporting to the Netherlands (NL) — plenty of room to increase imports/reduce exports.

Given RYHPS’s tendency to price very high in the BM, there was a strong likelihood of NG calling a BSAD auction, especially across NL.


System events

In the morning, the IFA1 (France interconnector) tripped, reducing imports from 2 GW to 1 GW (expected back by 18:00, but often extended).

Despite this, the BM was only 200–300 MW short.

Wind reforecast was down from DA (unexpected with already low wind), but wind outturn actually over-delivered to PNs.

Demand was soft during the morning peak.

Midday developments

Around 12:30, two CNQP units came off PN and offered themselves on extension in the BM — allowing NG to extend them half-hourly, instead of turning on RYHPS for a minimum run time.

The SP26 cashout reached £487/MWh as the system was short, with CNQP4 the marginal unit being extended.

MEDWAY (MEDP) was ramping, but with only 35 MW of volume, CNQP4’s £487 set

Later, CNQP2 & 3 and South Humber Bank (SHBA1) were also taken on extension.
Eventually, RYHPS was taken on in SP31, priced between £450–£550, pushing Block 5B to trade up to £320, and even £400+ in some SPs.

BSAD actions

During this time, NG called BSADs across BN and NEMO, bringing in cheaper interconnector imports to avoid expensive CCGT offers.

Actual interconnector flows show that Britned, which was nominated to export 1 GW after 17:00, ended up importing ~200 MW instead — equivalent to an extra ~1 GW appearing in the GB BM around SP35.

In SP35, when GB was 745 MW short, prices were around £248/MWh, below CCGT offers (£469–£848) and the earlier Block 5B prices (~£320).

This demonstrates the BSAD imports effectively capped the cashout price risk.

Intraday market behaviour

Block 5B traded up to £320, pricing in risk of high CCGT cashout (~£450–£550).

Once the market realised BSAD volume was coming in cheaper, prices crashed down by ~£200 toward BSAD levels.

Later, prices ticked back up to around £250 as BSAD prices rose slightly.

For 6A/front 6B, there was potential for another high short cashout if BSAD volume dropped and the system stayed short — though in hindsight, BSADs continued, preventing that.
