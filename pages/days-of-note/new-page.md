# Friday, 17th Oct 2025

Last day of the high over Britain regime

No notable PN adjustments - Efficient units running overnight with some semi efficient units

Morning shortness on the peak a managed fully by batteries

SEAB1 - was extended in the BM at 104 and was run for most of today.

System was long most of the day, being set by CCGTs being bid down in the BM

Demand as line with BMRS overnight, slightly under for the morning peak

Wind was over PNs all day - wind so low it only can over delivery

However there is a large reforecast down after 1800

Interconnectors

FR - full import

BE/ NL mixed profiles with rooms either side for BSAD - which I don’t think will be required today

Again we are seeing this reduction on FR interconnector at 1600 today  - I would expect due to a system constraint
