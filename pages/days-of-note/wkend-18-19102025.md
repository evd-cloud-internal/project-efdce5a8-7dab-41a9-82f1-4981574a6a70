Forward Look – CCGT Behaviour in the Gas Market

Current Outlook:
Based on current Trayport prices for gas, power, and UKAs, both efficient and semi-efficient CCGTs are in the money to run on Saturday.

However, I do not expect CCGTs to have a significant impact on within-day (WD) gas for Saturday delivery, nor on the Saturday gas market today. 

Sunday Delivery

Under current Trayport pricing, all CCGT efficiency levels are out of the money for Sunday base.

This suggests that Sunday gas prices are likely to soften after 11:00 tomorrow, once the N2EX Day-Ahead (DA) auction results are published and CCGTs establish their running profiles — most of which I expect to not be running.

Shift traders will likely observe a flat power position and a long gas position, prompting selling of the DA (Sunday) gas.

In this situation, if I was managing my assets and did not expect my units to clear, I would sell some gas ahead of the auction to avoid being exposed to the post-auction DA gas ( Sunday gas in this situation, not Monday delivery gas ) price dip.

Into Sunday Delivery

National grid will be looking at the grid and with no CCGTs on PN they will need to turn CCGTs on WD ie in the BM

Certain units, such as Seabank, are usually required to run by National Grid (NG) for system constraint reasons.

These generators are unlikely to sell power at small margins in the N2ex auction when they can instead raise their BM offer prices, knowing they are likely to be dispatched in high-wind scenarios.

This behaviour leaves CCGTs short gas within-day and thus they lift the WD gas price - usually towards the end of the shift so they don't over hedge the gas. 

Looking at current Sunday price levels, it is possible that only the most efficient CCGTs may secure a short 6-hour run, but overall participation will be low.

The vast majority of CCGTs are therefore expected to come on in the BM rather than through the DA auction ie will be selling their Sunday gas, and buy it back WD Sunday.
