Intraday Market Summary

Weather and System Conditions

High pressure remains over Britain, keeping temperatures around seasonal averages and wind generation low. As a result, expectations for prices to rise are limited.

Demand showed no major changes compared to Day-Ahead (DA) levels.

During the morning peak, the system was mostly balanced using battery assets.


Power Markets

The N2EX auction cleared at £160/MWh for the block 5 (17:00–19:00), interestingly the back 2 hours ( 5B) cleared high at £205/MWh.

In the intraday market, the 5B period opened at £160 and trended downward throughout the day.
Morning PNs were submitted for RYHSP, CNQPS, SEAB, and MEDP (correction from yesterday — MEDP were not spare).

Only CNQPS Units 1 and 4 were available today, as CNQPS Unit 3 was offline (there are four CNQP units in total).

Based on recent behaviour, I expected CNQPS and RYHSP to come off PNs around 12:00. After several days of similar strategies, the question is whether other CCGTs will follow suit — potentially causing a “race to the bottom” in the offer stack as they undercut each other to secure dispatch from National Grid (NG).

Interconnector Flows (Day-Ahead)

France (FR): Fully importing, no remaining capacity.

Belgium (BE): Almost fully importing, with minimal headroom.

Netherlands (NL): Significant spare capacity, with exports occurring.

Intraday Developments

As the day progressed:

CNQPS and RYHSP came off their PNs around 12:00.

RYHSP was not extended.

CNQPS4 came off PN earlier at 11:00 and was extended at £178/MWh until 13:00.

CNQPS1 came off at 12:00 (alongside RYHSP) and was extended at £149/MWh.

I suspect RYHSP’s offer price was higher than CNQPS1’s, which may explain why it was not taken. Another factor could be unit size — RYHSP is larger, so even if priced the same, it would still represent a higher total cost to NG.

When CNQPS4 dropped off at 13:30, NG took MEDP on extension at £148.99 and ROCK at £145/MWh around 14:00.

By Settlement Period 33 (16:00), BSAD volumes increased, reflecting growing confidence among CCGTs that they would be dispatched during the evening peak, leading to a rise in prices.

Market Trading

Unfortunately, I don’t have the 5B price chart, but it didn’t rally as strongly as in recent days — prices mostly trended downward.

There was, however, a brief rise in the half-hourly (HH) period before prices fell back again.

Notable Observation

The most interesting behaviour came from CNQPS4’s PN strategy.

I originally thought they I sold themselves in the intraday market, for that second PN, possibly explaining why we didn’t see the sharp 5B price rally observed previously.

Selling 350 MW might not have been enough to fully suppress 5B prices, but the lower-than-expected trading levels may suggest CNQP4’s shift traders believed they had a low probability of being taken.

They may also have been cautious about ROCK’s pricing — as a new participant in the market that day, ROCK’s position likely introduced additional uncertainty (I’m not sure who manages ROCK).

 

Further Notes 

On further inspecting the up ramp rate (on the second PN) and the min zero and min run times - It looks likely CNQPS4 did have 2 separate PNs in and NG took them for the run through between the two PNs (if they had sold in intraday the second PN would have been a vertical line not a slopped one)
