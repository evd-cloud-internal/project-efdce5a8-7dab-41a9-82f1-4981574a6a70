# Intraday Asset Behviours

These pages aim to provide insight into how UK power assets operate intraday and how their behaviour influences the wider UK power market.

Intraday power prices in the UK  are largely driven by the balancing actions of National Grid ESO. To maintain system balance and keep frequency stable, National Grid adjusts generation  in real time — turning assets up or down as required.

The price of these balancing actions is derived from the bids and offers submitted by each available asset ahead of delivery. THe asset managers must submit their prices 1 hour before delivery, at which point the market reaches gate closure. After gate closure, these prices cannot be amended and are published to the market.

Understanding how assets position themselves ahead of gate closure — and how they are subsequently dispatched — is key to interpreting intraday price formation.
